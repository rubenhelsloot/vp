//Remove the only node
l --> [1] --> =
l = null;
l --> =

A list is a recursive data structure

A list is
	- empty
	- contains 1 node that points to a list (recursion)
	
//Some code that was implemented into List.java

Assignment operator: '='
a = b = 7; //Evaluated right to left

List is doubly linked because removal is a lot quicker

EBNF: Extended Bachers Nauer format
Terminals --> between '' quotes --> literal
Non-terminals --> have to be defined

capitalA = 'A';
a b --> first a and then b
a | b --> a or b
[a] --> a yes or no € [0,1]
{a} --> a >= 0 € [0,∞)
a{a} --> a >= 1 € [1,∞)
